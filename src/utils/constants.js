//NAMED EXPORT 

export const CDN_URL = "https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_660/";

export const LOGO_URL = "https://www.logodesign.net/logo/smoking-burger-with-lettuce-3624ld.png";


//when we need to export multiple things from a single file -> we use named export not the default export cause default export can't be used multiple times.
