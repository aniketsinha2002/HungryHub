## THE LIVE LINK WON'T WORK ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

The **LIVE LINK may NOT work** as **the project is utilizing Swiggiy's live API**, and **it keeps changing time to time so the code breaks**.

**The structure of objects within Swiggy's live API is dynamic, with updates and changes occurring almost daily. :(**

Therefore, it won't display resturants data live. Therefore I have attached a video demonstrating the working functionalities. [SEE VIDEO DEMO HERE](https://www.loom.com/share/38f40a7fffda4e459d29446e215cb506?sid=6c9a3382-4ae2-447c-a4bd-e2b7870800a1)

## WEB PERFORMANCE && OPTIMIZATION üòÆüòÆüòÆ

Achieved a page load time of just 117ms. (See attached screenshot)

Goal: To enhance the website's performance, ensuring it loads quickly and provides a smooth user experience.

### Generated Report: ‚≠ê

After implementing various optimization strategies, a detailed performance report was generated. You can view the full analysis [here](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-myhungryhub-netlify-app/bzjha9jzi4?form_factor=desktop).

### Achieved Results: (Performance Rating of 99)‚≠ê

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** 0.7 seconds  
  FCP measures the time it takes for the browser to render the first piece of content from the DOM.

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** 0.7 seconds  
  LCP measures the time it takes for the browser to render the largest content element on the page.

- **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** 0 ms  
  TBT indicates the total time the main thread is blocked during page load, preventing other tasks from running.

- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** 0.003
  CLS measures the sum of all unexpected layout shifts of visible elements during page load.

- **Speed Index** 1.3s
  Speed Index shows how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated.

### Implemented Strategies: ‚≠ê

_Redux Store for Caching:_ Cached frequently used data across the app.
_Code Splitting:_ Divided code into smaller chunks for faster initial load times.
_Lazy Loading with Infinite Scroll:_ Efficiently loaded restaurant data as users scroll.
_Code Optimization:_ Streamlined and optimized the codebase for better performance.
_Conditional Rendering with Shimmer UI:_ Enhanced user experience by showing a loading indicator during data fetching, improving app responsiveness.
_Efficient JSX Rendering:_ Rendered components conditionally based on data, reducing unnecessary load on the browser.
