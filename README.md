## THE LIVE LINK WON'T WORK ⚠️⚠️

The live link won't work as the project is utilizing Swiggiy's live API, and it is showing "unauthorized" even after allowing CORS. Therefore, it won't display resturants data live. I have attached a video demonstrating the working functionalities hosted from localhost.
